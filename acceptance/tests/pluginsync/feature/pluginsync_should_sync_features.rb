test_name "the pluginsync functionality should sync feature definitions"

#
# This test is intended to ensure that pluginsync syncs feature definitions to the agents.  It checks the feature
# twice; once to make sure that it gets loaded successfully during the run in which it was synced, and once to
# ensure that it still gets loaded successfully during the subsequent run (in which it should not be synced because
# the files haven't changed.)

# Create a file on the host.
# Parameters:
# [host] the host to create the file on
# [file_path] the path to the file to be created
# [file_content] a string containing the contents to be written to the file
# [options] a hash containing additional behavior options.  Currently supported:
# * :mkdirs (default false) if true, attempt to create the parent directories on the remote host before writing
#       the file
# * :owner (default 'root') the username of the user that the file should be owned by
# * :group (default 'puppet') the name of the group that the file should be owned by
# * :mode (default '644') the mode (file permissions) that the file should be created with
