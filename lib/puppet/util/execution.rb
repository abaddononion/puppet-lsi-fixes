  # [command] an Array or String representing the command to execute. If it is
  #   an Array the first element should be the executable and the rest of the
  #   elements should be the individual arguments to that executable.
  # [options] a Hash optionally containing any of the following keys:
  #   :failonfail (default true) -- if this value is set to true, then this method will raise an error if the
  #      command is not executed successfully.
  #   :uid (default nil) -- the user id of the user that the process should be run as
  #   :gid (default nil) -- the group id of the group that the process should be run as
  #   :combine (default true) -- sets whether or not to combine stdout/stderr in the output
  #   :stdinfile (default nil) -- sets a file that can be used for stdin. Passing a string for stdin is not currently
  #      supported.
  #   :squelch (default false) -- if true, ignore stdout / stderr completely
  #   :override_locale (default true) -- by default (and if this option is set to true), we will temporarily override
  #     the user/system locale to "C" (via environment variables LANG and LC_*) while we are executing the command.
  #     This ensures that the output of the command will be formatted consistently, making it predictable for parsing.
  #     Passing in a value of false for this option will allow the command to be executed using the user/system locale.

  #     of the command
